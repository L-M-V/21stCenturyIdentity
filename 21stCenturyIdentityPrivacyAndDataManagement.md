# 21st Century Identity, Privacy and Data Management

A Digital identity revolution is coming. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a complete inversion of current identity management, giving granular control of personal data to the user. This has exciting and broad ramifications for user privacy, data collection and data transfer. How can governments and organisations  both facilitate and make use of this new model of identity and personal information transfer and management?

This document is broken down into chapters.
- Chapter one explains digital identities and how they have evolved over time.
- Chapter two explores current issues with identity and personal data management. 
- Chapter three investigates Self-Sovereign Identity software solutions and programs.
- Chapter four looks at government datasets and data flows and how they could be implemented through a SSI system.
- Chapter five summarises the findings.


Questions: What is your identity? How do you prove your identity? How do you trust another person's identity? How does the government use your identity? How does the government user your data to provide services?

# Chapter One - The Evolution of Identity

## What is a Digital Identity?

Wikipedia defines Digital Identity as "A digital identity is information on an entity used by computer systems to represent an external agent. That agent may be a person, organization, application, or device." 

## The History Of Digital Identity

Christopher Allen is co-chair of the W3C Credentials Community Group which is working on standards for decentralised identity. Christopher is a pioneer in internet cryptography and worked with Netscape to develop the SSL security protocol and co-author of the IETF TLS internet draft which was used as the heart of all secure commerce of the World World Web. Christopher breaks down identity management into four stages.

### Centralised / Traditional (Siloed) Identity

This identity model is the traditional make up. 


### Federated Identity

# Issues with the Current System

<ins>Risks</ins>

**Data Silos** - Large Centralised Identity providers have access to millions of digital identities which makes them a target. (For example Yahoo and Equifax Data Breaches.)

**Lack Of Transparency** - How is user data being used? (Is it marketing? Political Analysis?).  Is it being transferred to additional third parties?  (Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal)

**Re-Identification of other Data Sets** - By cross-referencing information contained in their databases, centralised providers may be able to reidentify existing public datasets.
