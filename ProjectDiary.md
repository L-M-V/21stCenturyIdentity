### 21st Century Privacy  

# Friday
- Analyse challenges list
- Decide on challenges

## Main Challenges
- ### How might we build telemetry and data insights without compromising citizen privacy?

>The pandemic has seen a massive shift to government digital services. Increasing amounts of personal data are required from citizens to support the pandemic response like QR code contact tracing apps, post vaccine surveys and business support grants.
>
>How might the Victorian Government improve and safeguard citizens privacy and ownership of their personal data?

_Eligibility: Participants must use one or more datasets from Data.Vic._

_Entry: Challenge entry is available to all teams in Australia._

- ### In order to access online services, citizens need to give their consent for their data to be used. How do you gain their trust that their data will be used appropriately?

>There has always been concerns around data governance and citizens having no visibility of what data is being collected from them, in which way and how it is being used. The terms and conditions might list these details, but it is not always the case that the citizens read (due to the length of it) or understand (due to the way it is written) it. This ties back to the trust that citizens have that the data is being used for bettering the systems and products.
>
>In your solution, we would like you to consider who should have control of the citizen’s data – is it the citizens themselves or the Government or someone else?
>
>How do we make what is collected visible to the citizen?
>
>What technologies would you use, for example, blockchain or other technology?

_Job opportunity:_
_• All finalists will have an opportunity to be interviewed for a job opportunity if interested._

## Secondary Challenges
- ### How can we re-imagine digital government services in Australia to enable a seamless experience for people of all abilities.

>
>The rapid digitalisation in the last 18-months due to the global health crisis has required the government to enable digital government services to extend important services to citizens.
>
> The global health crisis has seen people gravitate towards digital government services whether by necessity or choice. Citizens expect the government to enable best in class digital government services for people of all abilities. It’s important for these services to be accessible, responsive, transparent, secure, and importantly connected, enabling a seamless experience.
>
>While working on this challenge, participants are expected to reimagine digital government services and how these could be better made available to citizens by seamlessly integrating services that support people’s needs across life events. Participants will need to think of ideas to deliver digital government services that are simple and personalised across multiple agencies.
>
>The solutions will need to look at accessibility, responsiveness, security, privacy, transparency, and importantly enable a unified experience. For instance, a seamless experience would entail that the system pre-fills and submits your forms when you request it, pre-assesses your eligibility, and makes automatic payments. All this by enabling secure exchange of data and protecting privacy.
>
>The solution needs to look at connecting government services behind the scenes and offer the consumer a seamless way to get what they need and when they need it.

- ### How can the general public learn about and be encouraged to interact with the Australian Skills Classification to identify skills within occupations, identify their own skillsets and identify transferability to other occupations of interest?

>The challenge involves exploring how the Australian Skills Classification can be made useful to the general public (including young people, job seekers and those looking for job transitions) for use in identifying existing skill and pathways of transition to occupations of interest.
The Australian Skills Classification
>
>The National Skills Commission (NSC) was established in July 2020, under the National Skills Commissioner Act 2020 and is supported by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment.
>
>The Australian Skills Classification (the Classification) was released by the NSC as a beta in March 2021. >The Classification is a brand new way of categorising skills, and it systematically sets out a structure for and relationships between skills within occupations and across the labour market.
>
>The Classification currently provides occupation profiles outlining the core competencies, technology tools, and specialist tasks for 600 occupations. The Classification identifies:
> - 10 core competencies: common skills used in all occupations
> - 88 technology tools: a technology, such as software or hardware, associated with a job
> - 1925 specialist tasks: detailed work activities required within a job.
>
>The new way of categorising skills and its relationship with occupations can be illustrated in the following example. Sales Assistants is the largest employing occupation in Australia. This occupation requires skills in customer service, processing sales, maintaining product knowledge and monitoring inventories. The Classification allows users to see which other occupations also require these skills. For instance 13 other occupations also perform the task of “Advise customers on the use of goods or services”, including Landscape Architects and ICT Sales Professionals. Sales Assistants also have high competency levels for teamwork and use a variety of software and hardware in their roles, all of which can be seen in the Classification profile for this occupation.
>
>While training packages and industry organisations have defined certain skill sets for particular occupations, there has been a lack of a broader framework to identify and consistently measure and align skills. Instead, education levels, qualifications and occupations have been used as proxies for skill levels. While skills in individual occupations, qualifications are recognised, there has been a lack of understanding of how bundles of skills combine within occupations and can be transferable across different roles in the labour market.
>
>By categorising skills, and linking them to occupations, the Australian Skills Classification helps people such as job seekers and school leavers make informed decisions about jobs and career choices.
The Challenge
>
>Since the beta launch in March, the current users of the Skills Classification have mainly been industry associations and leaders, training and qualification providers, and policy makers and researchers. The challenge is now to explore how the Skills Classification can be made useful to the general public (including young people, job seekers and those looking for job transitions) for use in identifying existing skills and pathways of transition to occupations of interest.
>
>This challenge could involve developing a new interface, for example that is better targeted to these demographics with new ways of navigating or other functionality that allows the general public to explore and becoming familiar with using the Classification.

_Eligibility: Participants must use the Australian Skills Classification dataset._

_Entry: Challenge entry is available to all teams in Australia._


# Saturday

# Idea:

Utilising self-sovereign identity technology to enhance Government services.

Project outcomes:
- An explanation of self-sovereign identity
- Application Mockup exploring how a user would interact with the system
- Example data-flows between organisations
- Workflow diagrams for understanding how it would be implemented by government and business. 
- Applying datasets for particular examples and use-cases
- Video exploring various government <-> citizen relationships


Thoughts:
 - Verified Education / Skill-sets through the network
 - Automatic Check-ins via Network Cell Phone Data in secure way
 - Collection of Data for Municipal Planning

## Existing Technology:

## Discussions

### A Discussion with Simon De Sousa from Data.Vic (Super Helpful!)
Utilising metadata to illustrate data flows between business, government and citizens. 

Recommendations for more detailed datasets: 
Crash Stats Vic roads data extract
building permit data - metadata - vba


### Discussions with friends about other Data Sovereignty Concerns
Problem 
Reidentification Risk
Consulting (e.g. Quantium / Deloitte) doing the analysis for separation of powers

Indigenous Data Sovereignty 
Changing datasets after they've been collected (living datasets) - changing your indigenous status afterwards
